                             CONCLUSION
                             
This project of Social media networking project is a precise demonstration of how one
can use a data structures and algorithms as a tool in order to understand it in the best ways
possible and implement the same in real world projects with a few modifications into it
todayâ€™s problems. In addition to that, how real-world technologies are using the same graph algorithms in
order to perform the same tasks in a much simpler and faster way. The future scope of social media is an all-inclusive platform that prioritizes user
experience and connects people in real-time. Social media has the scope to be more video
centric, new ways to stream ephemeral content and provide vertical networks for like
minded people at one platform. Users need a platform that values creativity and
friendships as social media now-a-days has drifted people apart. Social media has the
scope to be more inclusive and provide a space for people to portray their real selves. A platform with entertainment for different categories of audiences. Quality combined
with innovation is the way to go
